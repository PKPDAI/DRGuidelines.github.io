## Annotation Guidelines ss

The classification task consists on labelling PubMed documents as either **Relevant** or **Not Relevant** depending on whether _in_ _vivo_ pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were estimated in that particular publication. To consider a particular publication as **Relevant** the estimated parameters might appear in either the abstract, tables or full-text. The following are the specific rules behind each label:

### Relevant

1. The abstract or paper must discuss or include one of the following:
	AUC
	CL or Q (only as interdepartment clearance, not blood flow)
	Cmax, Tmax 
	Cmin (or trough), Css
	k or K – rate constants, ignore Kp 
	t1/2 (α, β if present), 
	V 
	F  
	Vmax and Km (only if the pharmacokinetic model includes michaelis-menten kinetic terms)
2. If the article concerns Phase I or Phase II studies, check the article contains new PK parameters.
3. If the article is PK/PD, check the article contains new PK parameters.
4. If the abstract mentions structure activity relationship (SAR) and the article contains PK parameters – please comment if this is the case.
5. If the abstract concerns glucose-insulin kinetics:
	The glucose or insulin needs to be radiolabelled
	And/or in Type I diabetics – as endogenous insulin is likely to be very low.
6. If the abstract concerns the kinetics of an endogenous element e.g. Mn, Fe, Ca – then it must be radiolabelled
7. No abstract, but the title comes across as relevant. These are either older articles or those in a foreign language.
8. If the abstract is a Review or Meta-analysis, but contains new PK parameters. These are not very frequent but important


### Not Relevant

1. No abstract, and the title does not come across as relevant – Please add a comment
2. The abstract mentions:
	PBPK / simulation
	Structure activity relationship (SAR) – but no PK parameters
3. The article is a Review or Meta-analysis (normally mentioned in Publication Type on PubMed) – Please add a comment
4. The article is concerned with PET imaging/MRI kinetics, or the development of probe substrates.
5. The abstract concerns glucose-insulin kinetics in non-diabetic and/or non-radiolabelled.
6. If the abstract concerns the kinetics of an endogenous element e.g. Mn, Fe, Ca – that are not radiolabelled
